# Pollstar Bands: A Regression Analysis
A regression analysis I did for the Emporia Granada Theatre (EGT) to help predict the efficacy of potential concerts in the future.

Files:
1. README.md  - This file
2. Pollstar Regression Report.pdf   - An extensive report in PDF format outlining the methods used and the overall procedure of the analysis.  Anyone curious about the methods used in this analysis should be directed to this file.
3. Pollstar Regression Dashboard.xlsx   - Dashboard for utilizing the resultant models, in the form of a downloadable Excel workbook. Anyone interested in the end-result should download this file.

Usage of the dashboard is simple: You simply select a band from the dropdown list at the top of the dashboard, and the information will auto-populate.  New bands can be added in the Bands sheet.  If a band is selected that does not meet the requirements of a given model, this will be indicated by a cell highlighted in red, specific to whatever range assumption is being violated.

At EGT the dashboard is hosted on Google Sheets, and is integrated with a Google Form to make adding new bands easy and user-friendly.  Since the dashboard was built in Google Sheets, this may be the best place to view it.  Proper formatting is not guaranteed in MS Excel.
