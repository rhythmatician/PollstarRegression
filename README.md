# PollstarRegression
A regression analysis I did for the Emporia Granada Theatre (EGT) to help predict the efficacy of potential concerts in the future.

Files:
1. README.md - This file
2. Pollstar Regression Report.pdf - An extensive report in PDF format outlining the methods used and the overall procedure of the analysis.
3. Pollstar Regression Dashboard.xlsx - Dashboard for utilizing the resultant models, in the form of a downloadable Excel workbook.

Usage of the dashboard is simple: You simply select a band from the dropdown list at the top of the dashboard, and the information will auto-populate.  New bands can be added in the Bands sheet.  At EGT this is hosted on google sheets, and is integrated with a Google Form to make adding new bands easy.
